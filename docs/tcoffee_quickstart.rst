********************************
Brief Overview of T-Coffee Tools
********************************

.. note:: We only give you the very basics here, please go to the **T-Coffee manual** for a more detailed description and available options for the different tools. You can also try the **T-Coffee tutorial** for a practical training on T-Coffee alignment and other functions using applied examples on published research data.

T-Coffee
========
Write or copy all your sequences (protein, DNA or RNA) in a given text file using one of the following format: Swiss-Prot, FASTA or PIR; then run T-Coffee with the following command line:

::

  $$: t_coffee sample_seq1.fasta



This will output three files:
 - ``sample_seq1.aln`` : multiple sequence alignment (ClustalW format by default)
 - ``sample_seq1.dnd`` : guide tree (Newick format) 
 - ``sample_seq1.html`` : colored MSA according to T-Coffee consistency color scheme (html)


.. tip:: In principle, the type of the sequences is automatically detected and the default methods adapted accordingly. Sometimes, however, this may fail either because the sequences are too short or contain too many ambiguity codes. When this happens, you are advised to explicitly set the type of your sequences using the flag **-type**.

::

  $$: t_coffee sample_dnaseq1.fasta -type=dna


.. note:: Please cite: Notredame, C., Higgins, D.G., Heringa, J. T-Coffee: a novel method for fast and accurate multiple sequence alignment. J. Mol. Biol., 302(1):205-217 (2000), PMID:10964570 and/or Magis, C., Taly, J.-F., Bussotti, G., Chang, J.M., Di Tommaso, P., Erb, I., Espinosa-Carrasco, J., Notredame, C. **T-Coffee: tree-based consistency objective function for alignment evaluation**. Methods Mol. Biol., 1079:117-129 (2014), PMID:24170398


M-Coffee
========
M-Coffee is a meta version of T-Coffee that combines the output of eight aligners (MUSCLE, ProbCons, POA, DIALIGN-T, MAFFT, ClustalW, PCMA and T-Coffee); when installing T-Coffee, all required packages are automatically installed on your computer. To use M-Coffee, write your sequences in a file (format: Swiss-Prot, FASTA or PIR) and run the following command line:

::

  $$: t_coffee sample_seq1.fasta -mode mcoffee


M-Coffee is a predefined combination of different types of aligners; there is a faster version called fm-Coffee which combines the fastest aligners (Kalign, MUSCLE and MAFFT):

::

  $$: t_coffee sample_seq1.fasta -mode fmcoffee

Also, the user can make its own combination of aligners included in T-Coffee by specifying the list of packages to be combined; here is an example of T-Coffee combining ClustalW, Kalign and ProbCons:

::

  $$: t_coffee sample_seq1.fasta -method clustalw_pair, kalign_pair, probcons_pair
  
  
.. warning:: If the program starts complaining one package or the other is missing, this means you will have to go the hard way and install all these packages yourself...


.. note:: Please cite: Wallace, I.M., O'Sullivan, O., Higgins, D.G., Notredame, C. **M-Coffee: combining multiple sequence alignment methods with T-Coffee**. Nucleic Acids Res., 34(6):1692-1699 (2006), PMID:16556910


Expresso
========
The default installation of T-Coffee provides you with the EBI wublast.pl client required to run Expresso. Using this, Expresso will BLAST your sequences against the PDB database, identify the best targets (by default X-RAY structures, minimum 35% identical to your sequences) and use them to align your proteins using a structural aligner. Expresso automatically generates a template file (``<your file name>_pdb1.template_list``) that can be used for further use. Run Expresso with the following command:

::

  $$: t_coffee sample_seq1.fasta -mode expresso



If all the required structural packages for Expresso were not installed or if you want to select another structural aligner, you can select the structural package you want to use. For instance, if can use TM-align rather than SAP:

::

  $$: t_coffee sample_seq1.fasta -template_file expresso -method TMalign_pair


.. note:: Please cite: Armougom, F., Moretti, S., Poirot, O., Audic, S., Dumas, P., Schaeli, B., Keduas, V., Notredame. C. **Expresso: automatic incorporation of structural information in multiple sequence alignments using 3D-Coffee**. Nucleic Acids Res., 34:W604-W608 (2006), PMID:16845081


Pro-Coffee
==========
Pro-Coffee is a particular mode of T-Coffee designed to align specific functional DNA sequences, in particular regulatory regions. To run Pro-Coffee by default, type:

::

  $$: t_coffee sampe_dnaseq1.fasta -mode procoffee
  

In order to adjust the quality of the alignment, Pro-Coffee allows you to modify gap penalties (gap-opening and/or gap-extension) using the following command line:


::

  $$: t_coffee sample_dnaseq1.fasta -method promo_pair@EP@GOP@-60@GEP@-1

.. note:: Please cite: Erb, I., Gonz√°lez-Vallinas, J.R., Bussotti, G., Blanco, E., Eyras, E., Notredame, C. **Use of ChIP-Seq data for the design of a multiple promoter-alignment method**. Nucleic Acids Res., 40(7):e52 (2012), PMID:22230796.

R-Coffee
========
R-Coffee can be used to align RNA sequences, using their RNApfold predicted secondary structures. The best results are obtained by using the Consan pairwise method. If you have Consan installed (under maintenance...), run:

::

  $$: t_coffee sample_rnaseq1.fasta -mode rcoffee_consan

This will only work if your sequences are short enough (less than 200 nucleotides). A good alternative is the rmcoffee mode that will run MUSCLE, ProbCons4RNA and MAFFT and then use the secondary structures predicted by RNApfold:

::

  $$: t_coffee sample_rnaseq1.fasta -mode rmcoffee

If you want to select yourself which methods should be combined by R-Coffee, run:

::

  $$: t_coffee sample_rnaseq1.fasta -mode rcoffee -method lalign_id_pair,slow_pair

.. note:: Please cite: Wilm, A., Higgins, D.G., Notredame, C. **R-Coffee: a method for multiple alignment of non-coding RNA**. Nucleic Acids Res., 36(9):e52 (2008), PMID:18420654

TCS
===
TCS is an alignment evaluation score that makes it possible to identify the most correct positions in an MSA. 
It has been shown that these positions are the most likely to be structuraly correct and also the most informative when estimating phylogenetic trees. The TCS evaluation and filtering procedure is implemented in the T-Coffee package and can be used to evaluate and filter any third party MSA (including T-Coffee MSA of course!). 

It's usage is a bit tricky as it comes with a lot of different options, go to the **T-Coffee Main Documentation**, section **How Good Is Your Alignment** to have all the details about TCS.

Evol., 31(6), 1625‚Äì1637 (2014), PMID:24694831 and/or Chang, J.-M., Di Tommaso, P., Lefort, V., Gascuel, O., Notredame, C. **TCS: a web server for multiple sequence alignment evaluation and phylogenetic reconstruction**. Nucleic Acids Res., 43(W1):W3-6 (2015), PMID:25855806

iRMSD/APDB
==========
iRMSD/APDB is not an alignment tool, it is an evalution tool of a given alignment using structural information. All you need is a file containing the alignment of sequences with a known structure. These sequences must be named according to their PDB ID, followed by the chain index (1aabA for instance). All the sequences do not need to have a known structure, but at least two is required. Given the alignment, use the command 1 if your sequences and structures have the same name; otherwise you have to declare the correspondence between sequences and structures in a template file (command 2).

::

  Command 1:
  $$: t_coffee -other_pg irmsd sample_3Dseq1.aln

  Command 2:
  $$: t_coffee -other_pg irmsd sample_3Dseq1.aln -template_file sample_3Dseq1.template

A template file is a FASTA-like file declaring the structure associated with each sequence. This file should have the following format:

::

  > <seq_name> _P_ <PDB structure file or name>

  ******* sample_3Dseq1.template *******
  >TNFR10-2  _P_ 1D4V2.pdb
  >TNFR10-3  _P_ 1D4V3.pdb
  ...

STRIKE

Under maintenance on the webserver or the T-Coffee package...

T-RMSD
======
T-RMSD is a structure based clustering method using the iRMSD to drive the structural clustering of your aligned sequences with an available structure. The T-RMSD supports all the parameters supported by iRMSD or APDB. To run T-RMSD, type:

::

  $$: t_coffee -other_pg trmsd sample_3Dseq1.aln -template_file sample_3Dseq1.template


The program then outputs a series of files:
 - ``sample_3Dseq1.struc_tree.list`` : list of the trees associated with every position.
 - ``sample_3Dseq1.struc_tree.html`` : colored columns according to the support to the tree.
 - ``sample_3Dseq1.struc_tree.consensus_output`` : schematic display of the results.
 - ``sample_3Dseq1.struc_tree.consensus`` : final consensus structural tree.
