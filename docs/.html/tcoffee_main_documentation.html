<p>This chapter has been extensively updated in 11/2016. We improved its readibility and incorporate all the latest development of the past years (PSI/TM-Coffee for homology extension based MSAs, Pro-Coffee for functional DNA, R-Coffee/SARA-Coffee for RNA, TCS and STRIKE for evaluating MSAs, T-RMSD for structural clustering). If you have any suggestion or correction, don’t hesitate to contact us.</p>

<h3>Foreword<a class="headerlink" href="#foreword" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most of the work presented here emanates from two summer schools that were tentatively called the ‘Prosite Workshops’ and were held in Marseille, in 2001 and 2002. These workshops were mostly an excuse to go rambling and swimming in the creeks of Cassis (Calanques). Yet, when we got tired of lazing in the sun, we eventually did a bit of work to chill out. Most of our experiments were revolving around the development of sequence analysis tools. Many of the most advanced ideas in T-Coffee were launched during these fruitful sessions. Participants included Phillip Bucher, Laurent Falquet, Marco Pagni, Alexandre Gattiker, Nicolas Hulo, Christian Siegfried, Anne-Lise Veuthey, Virginie Leseau, Lorenzo Ceruti and Cedric Notredame.</p>

<h3>Prerequisite for using T-Coffee<a class="headerlink" href="#prerequisite-for-using-t-coffee" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This documentation relies on the assumption that you have installed T-Coffee, version 9.03 or higher (preferably the latest stable version). T-Coffee is a freeware open source running on all Unix-like platforms including Mac OS X, woever, it cannot run on Windows except by using Cygwin, a freeware open source allowing to run a Unix-like command line on Windows (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.cygwin.com/">download</a>). A better option for Windows users would be to install a Unix-like virtualbox on your computer. All the relevant information for installing T-Coffee is contained in the previous chapter <strong>T-Coffee Installation</strong>.</p>

<p>This manual is made to help you discover (nearly) all subtleties of T-Coffee, from default applications to sophisticated ones. All along this documentation, we expect you to use Unix-like shell commands running on prepared example files we have created. For now you can find all these files on our github repository for now: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cbcrg/tcoffee/tree/master/examples">example files</a>; however in the future they will be included in the T-Coffee distribution (~/tcoffee/Version…/examples/). All T-Coffee commands indicated with a tag “$$:” are currently up and running; just copy/paste these commands from the documentation (without the tag “$$:”) to your terminal provided you previously downloaded the example files. We encourage you to try all these examples which are controlled cases, and also to try these commands with your own data files. All T-Coffee commands indicated with a tag “$#:” are currently under maintenance. Also, be aware that all the values/results given in this manual were obtained with different versions of T-Coffee; depending on the version of T-Coffee you are using, these results may slightly differ.</p>

<h3>What is T-Coffee?<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>T-Coffee stands for <strong>“Tree based Consistency Objective Function For alignment Evaluation”</strong>. It is mainly/primarily a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) method but it also provides a collection of useful/powerful tools presented in this manual. Before going deep into the core of the matter, here are a few words to briefly explain the things T-Coffee can do !!!</p>
<div class="section" id="what-does-it-do">
<h4>What does it do?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-does-it-do" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>T-Coffee has two components allowing you to perform different tasks:</dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>mainly it is a Multiple Sequence Alignment method.

<li><p>also it is a collection of tools (usually called with the flag <strong>-other_pg “tools”</strong>) and third party software (cf. section <strong>Integrating External Methods in T-Coffee</strong>) able to perform a wide range of operations such as aligning accurately, reformatting data, evaluating results, comparing methods and many more…</p></li>

<div class="section" id="what-can-it-align">
<h4>What can it align?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-can-it-align" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>T-Coffee will align nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein sequences alike. T-Coffee is also able to use other type of information such as secondary/tertiary structure information (for protein or RNA sequences with a known/predicted structure), sequence profiles, trees…</p>
<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="admonition-title">Hint</p>
<p>To have a rough idea, on an average computer, T-Coffee can easily align up to a 200 sequences, about 1000 amino acid long in about ~20min. It is better to avoid aligning more than 1000 sequences without using a cluster or T-Coffee fast modes !!!</p>

<p>T-Coffee is not an interactive program. It runs from your Unix or Linux command line and you must provide it with the correct parameters and syntax. If you do not like typing commands, you can still use the latest T-Coffee webserver <a class="reference external" href="http://tcoffee.crg.cat/apps/tcoffee/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Is T-Coffee different from ClustalW?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-t-coffee-different-from-clustalw" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>According to several benchmarks, T-Coffee is on overall much more accurate than ClustalW, but this increase in accuracy comes at a price: <strong>T-Coffee (default mode) is slower than ClustalW</strong> (about N times for N Sequences). Still, if you want to align closely related sequences, <strong>T-Coffee can be used in a fast mode, much faster and about as accurate than ClustalW</strong> (cf. section <strong>Building Multiple Sequence Alignment</strong>). If you are familiar with ClustalW or if you run a ClustalW server, you will find that we have made some efforts to ensure as much compatibility as possible between ClustalW and T-Coffee. Whenever it was relevant, we have kept the flag names and the flag syntax of ClustalW. Yet, you will find that T-Coffee also has many extra possibilities…</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="is-t-coffee-very-accurate">
<h4>Is T-Coffee very accurate?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-t-coffee-very-accurate" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>T-Coffee belongs to the category of consistency based aligners which currently corresponds to the most accurate algorithms available (e.g. ProbCons, MSAprobs…). In addition, T-Coffee can combine (many) methods and therefore be as accurate (and hopefully more) as the methods it combines. For instance, the “accurate” mode of T-Coffee is very slow but also very accurate; on average this mode was shown to be 10 % more accurate than normal aligners on sequences less than 30% similar. If you need a very accurate alignment go to section <strong>Building Multiple Sequence Alignment</strong>.</p>

<p>To be honest, a short answer will be that there is only one thing T-Coffee cannot do for you: <strong>T-Coffee can NOT fetch sequences for you</strong>. You must select the sequences you want to align beforehand and prepare your own dataset. We suggest you use any BLAST server and format your sequences in FASTA so that T-Coffee can use them easily.

<h4>What T-Coffee can do<a class="headerlink" href="#what-t-coffee-can-do" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>T-Coffee is not only just an aligner program, it comes with multiple tools and third party software increasing the range of its possibilities; here is a non exhaustive list of tasks T-Coffee can perform:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>T-Coffee can compute (or at least try to compute!) accurate Multiple Sequence Alignments of DNA, RNA or Protein sequences</strong>. Several modes and options are available and will be presented all along this manual. The default T-Coffee accepts any kind of sequence, although some modes are specific to a given type of sequence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>T-Coffee can help you to reformat, trim, clean, cut, color your input (sequences, structures…) or output (alignments, trees…) data</strong>; meaning that once you have your data and/or results ready, you can always modify them at will.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>T-Coffee allows you to combine results obtained with several alignment methods</strong> (see the section <strong>FAQ for T-Coffee</strong> and <strong>Building Multiple Sequence Alignment</strong> for more details). T-Coffee can virtually combine all these MSAs you have to produce a new Multiple Sequence Alignment having the best agreement with all these methods you tried.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>One of the most important improvement of T-Coffee is to let you combine sequences and structures</strong>, so that your alignments are of higher quality. You need to have the SAP package installed to fully benefit of this facility (or to use another structural alignment method).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>T-Coffee allows you to extract a collection of repeats from a single sequence or a set of sequences</strong> using MOCCA. In other words, if you know the coordinates of one copy of a repeat, you can extract all the other occurrences. MOCCA needs some time to compute a library and then prompt you with an interactive menu. You just have to follow the instructions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>T-Coffee can be used to measure the reliability of your Multiple Sequence Alignment</strong>. If you want to find out about that, read the section <strong>FAQ for T-Coffee</strong> or the <strong>Technical Documentation</strong> (-output flag). More details will be given anyway in this manual in the section <strong>How Good Is Your Alignment?</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>T-Coffee can be used to compare alternative alignment</strong>; in case you generate several alignments of the same sequences, you can compare these alignments using the most common scores (Sum-of-Pairs or Column Score). In case you have reference alignments, you can directly benchmark your method by comparing your MSAs to your references.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And probably many more options we will discover together all along this manual !</p>

<div class="section" id="how-does-t-coffee-alignment-works">
<h3>How does T-Coffee alignment works?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-t-coffee-alignment-works" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you only want to make a standard Multiple Sequence Alignment, you may skip these explanations. But if you want to do more sophisticated things, these few indications may help before you start reading the documentation and the different articles.</p>
<p>When you run T-Coffee, the first thing it does is to compute a library. The library is a list of pairs of residues that could be aligned…it is like a christmas list: you can ask anything you fancy, it doesn’t imply you will get it. Given a standard library, it is nearly impossible to have all the residues aligned at the same time because all the lines of the library may not agree. For instance:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Line</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">says</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="n">Residue</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">seq</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">Residue</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">seq</span> <span class="n">B</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="o">...</span>
<span class="n">Line</span> <span class="mi">100</span> <span class="n">says</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="n">Residue</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">seq</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">Residue</span> <span class="mi">29</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">seq</span> <span class="n">B</span><span class="p">,</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Each of these constraints comes with a weight and in the end, the T-Coffee algorithm tries to generate the multiple alignment that contains constraints whose sum of weights yields the highest score. In other words, it tries to make happy as many constraints as possible (replace the word constraint with, friends, relatives, collaborators… and you will know exactly what we mean). You can generate this list of constraints the way you like. You may even provide it yourself, forcing important residues to be aligned by giving them high weights (see <strong>FAQ for T-Coffee</strong>). For your convenience, T-Coffee can generate (by default) its own list by making all the possible global pairwise alignments, and the 10 best local alignments associated with each pair of sequences. Each pair of residues observed aligned in these pairwise alignments becomes a line in the library.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Be aware that nothing forces you to use a given library and that you could build it using other methods. In protein language, <strong>T-Coffee is synonymous for freedom, the freedom of being aligned however you fancy</strong> (I was probably a Tryptophan in some previous life).</p>

<p>About the syntax of T-Coffee command lines, just for you to know that it is quite flexible, for instance you can use any kind of separator you want (i.e. , ; &lt;space&gt; =). The syntax used in this document is meant to be consistent with that of ClustalW. However, in order to take advantage of the automatic filename completion provided by many shells, you can replace ‘=’ and ‘,’ with a space. Also, T-Coffee tools/modes are called using different flags to specify input/output files, parameters, modifiers, etc…Some flags are not always mandatory, however, if you use a correct/strict flag usage T-Coffee will always work fine; you just have some degrees of freedom ;-).</p>

<h4>General introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#general-introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Nothing is more frustrating than downloading important data and realizing you need to format it before using it. In general, you should avoid manual reformatting: it is by essence inconsistent and will get you into trouble. It will also get you depressed when you realize that you have spent the whole day adding carriage return to each line in your files. T-Coffee comes with several tools to reformat/trim/clean/select your input data but also your output results, especially a very powerful reformatting utility named <strong>seq_reformat</strong>. You can use <strong>seq_reformat</strong> by invoking the t_coffee shell:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$$: t_coffee -other_pg seq_reformat
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will output the online flag usage of seq_reformat meaning a complete list of things seq_reformat can do for you. The seq_reformat is a reformatting utility so it recognizes automatically the most common formats (FASTA, Swiss-Prot,ClustalW, MSF, Phylip…). It reads the input file(s) via the <strong>“-in”</strong> and <strong>“-in2”</strong> flags and outputs in whatever specified format via the <strong>“-output”</strong> flag. In the meantime, you can use the flag <strong>“-action”</strong> to perform a wide range of modification on your data. In this section we give you quite a lot of different examples of you can do with <strong>“-other_pg seq_reformat”</strong>.</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">Danger</p>
<p>After the flag <strong>-other_pg</strong>, the common T-Coffee flags are not recognized anymore; it is like if you were using a different program.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>When using T-Coffee seq_reformat, command line may become quite long…a practical way to handle this is to create in your .bashrc an alias to call directly seq_reformat. For example, write in your .bashrc: <strong>alias reformat=’t_coffee -other_pg seq_reformat’</strong>. You can now call seq_reformat by tiping <strong>reformat</strong>.</p>

<h5>What is a cache in T-Coffee?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-cache-in-t-coffee" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Several options can be performed easily by using what we call a cache (or cache file). In T-Coffee, a cache is a file containing an alternate version of your alignment where each position of the alignment is replaced by an alternative coding scheme. For instance each residue can be replaced by a score previously evaluated: this score can be the T-Coffee CORE index (cf. section <strong>Evaluating Your Alignment</strong>) or a matrix based evalution (blosum62mt or identity matrix). Then, when performing any modification or reformatting of your alignments, you can just specify the range of positions to be modified according to their respective scores within the cache. We will see some example especially regarding the modification of format of a given alignment; it is not mandatory to use a cache but it is quite practical. To generate a cache before any reformatting using a given evaluation score, you can use one of the following possible option:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Evaluating the T-Coffee CORE index during the alignment procedure:
$$: t_coffee sample_seq1.fasta -output=score_ascii

<p>The library is a special format used by T-Coffee to declare relationships between pairs of residues. The cache library format can also be used to declare for instance the color of specific residues in an alignment. For instance, the following file
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sample_dnaseq3.tc_lib</span></code> declares which residue of which sequence will receive which color. Note that the sequence number and the residue index are duplicated, owing to the recycling of this format from its original usage. It is also possible to use the BLOCK operator when defining the library (see <strong>Technical Documentation</strong>). The number right after BLOCK indicates the block length (10). The two next numbers (1 1) indicate the position of the first element in the block. The last value is the color.</p>

<h4>Changing the sequence format<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-the-sequence-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Sometimes it may be necessary to change from one format to another, for instance when using another software which recognize only a given format. T-Coffee recognizes most common alignment formats and you can find the list of all input or output format recognized by simply typing <strong>t_coffee -other_pg seq_reformat</strong> without any input file(s). It is possible to reformat unaligned or aligned sequences alike although changing the alignment format is probably more interesting in order to use other applications; unaligned sequences format flags are generally preceded by the suffix <strong>“_seq”</strong> and aligned sequences flags by the suffix <strong>“_aln”</strong>. This also allows you to transform any alignment into unaligned sequences by removing the gaps. Here are some examples on how to change the format of your data:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>For unaligned sequences (e.g. FASTA to PIR):
$$: t_coffee -other_pg seq_reformat -in proteases_small.fasta -output pir_seq &gt; \

$$: t_coffee -other_pg seq_reformat -in proteases_small.aln -output fasta_aln &gt; \
    proteases_small.fasta_aln

<p>Large datasets are problematic because they can be difficult to align and analyze, MSA programs tend to become very slow and inaccurate. In short, the best size for an MSA dataset would be between 20 to 40 sequences to have enough sequences to see the effect of evolution, but in the same time small enough so that you can visualize your alignment and recompute it as many times as needed. More important than its size, a good dataset have to be informative, when each sequence contains information the others do not have. The most informative sequences are the sequences that are as different as possible to one another, within your dataset. You can extract the most informative sequences using flag <strong>+trim</strong> followed by the number of sequences you wish to keep (“n” for a number and “N” for a perrcentage). The following commands will extract the 10 most informative sequences (command 1) or the 20% of most informative sequences (command 2):</p>

<p><strong>Removing too identical sequences (redundant)</strong></p>
<p>Removing the most similar sequences is often what people have in mind when they talk about removing redundancy. You can do so using the <strong>+trim</strong> option. For instance, you can generate a dataset where no pair of sequences has more than 50% identity either from a dataset of unaligned sequences (command 1) or from any given alignment (command 2). If you start from unaligned sequences, the removal of redundancy can be slow. If your sequences have already been aligned using a fast method, you can take advantage of this by replacing the <strong>“_seq_”</strong> with <strong>“_aln_”</strong>. Just run the following command lines to see the difference un runtime:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Command 1: unaligned sequences
$$: t_coffee -other_pg seq_reformat -in proteases_large.fasta -action +trim _seq_%%50_

Command 2: aligned sequences

</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Using aligned sequences results in a fastest trimming, however, it also means that you rely on a more approximate estimation of sequence similarity.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Removing too different sequences (outliers)</strong></p>
<p>Sequences that are too distantly related from the rest of the set (called outliers) may have very negative effects on the overall alignment; to prevent this, it is advisable not to use them. The next command line will lead to the removal of all the sequences where no pair of sequences has less than 30% average accuracy with all the other sequences in the dataset (the symbol “_O” stands for Outliers) and more than 80% identity:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$$: t_coffee -other_pg seq_reformat -in proteases_large.fasta -action +trim _seq_%%80_O30
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="admonition-title">Hint</p>
<p>This particular option is quite powerful as it allows you to decide both inferior and superior tresholds for trimming your dataset based on pairwise identity score, and therefore you can dissect your dataset according to different ranges of identity values. Be careful not to remove too many sequences ;-)</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Forcing specific sequences to be kept</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes you want to trim based on identity while making sure specific/important sequences remain in your dataset. You can do so by providing a pattern (<strong>“_f”</strong> for field) : it will keep all the sequences whose name contains the given string (<strong>“_fNAME”</strong>, <strong>“_fCOMMENT”</strong> or <strong>“_fSEQ”</strong>). Here are some examples corresponding to the different protected fields while removing all sequences above 50% identity:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Keep all HUMAN sequences
$$: t_coffee -other_pg seq_reformat -in proteases_large.fasta -action +trim \

<p>In order to align two distantly related sequences, most multiple sequence alignment packages perform better when provided with many intermediate sequences that make it possible to ‘bridge’ your two sequences. The modifier <strong>+chain</strong> makes it possible to extract from a dataset a subset of intermediate sequences that chain the sequences you are interested in. For instance, let us consider the two sequences “sp|P21844|MCPT5_MOUSE” and “sp|P29786|TRY3_AEDAE” having 26% identity. This is high enough to make a case for a homology relationship between them, but this is too low to blindly trust any pairwise alignment. With the names of the two sequences written in the file sproteases_pair.fasta, run the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$$: t_coffee -other_pg seq_reformat -in proteases_large.fasta -in2 proteases_pair.fasta \
    -action +chain &gt; proteases_chain.fasta
</pre></div>

<p>Extracting portions of a dataset is something very frequently needed. You may need to extract all the sequences that contain the word human in their name, or you may want all the sequences containing a simple motif. We show you here how to do a couple of these things.

<p>This generates a score_ascii file that you can then use to filter out the bad bits in your alignment considering the individual score of each residue to trigger the filtering (command 3), or according to the whole column score by simply add the <strong>+use_cons</strong> flag (command 4).

To do this with T-Coffee you need two input files: a tree file in the Newick format and a FASTA-like file where sequences can be omitted, but you can also leave them, at your entire convenience. The second file is merely a list of the sequences to be kept when pruning the tree. The resulting tree will contain only the sequences specified in the list.</p>

<p>The most common format for phylogenetic trees is newick, but some alternatives exist, including the one used by MAFFT for very large trees, in which the sequence names are replaced by their original index (1..N) in the sequence file.

<h4>Extracting a structure<a class="headerlink" href="#extracting-a-structure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>There are many reasons why you may need a structure. T-Coffee contains a powerful utility named <strong>extract_from_pdb</strong> that makes it possible to fetch the PDB coordinates of a structure or its FASTA sequence without requiring a local installation. By default, the option <strong>extract_from_pdb will</strong> start looking for the structure in the current directory; it will then look it up locally (PDB_DIR) and eventually try to fetch it from the web (via a wget to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rcsb.org">PDB</a>). All these settings can be customized using environment variables (see next paragraph). For instance if you want to fetch the chain E of the PDB structure 1PPG and/or its sequence in FASTA format, you can use:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Fetch the structure:
$$: t_coffee -other_pg extract_from_pdb -infile 1PPGE

<h4>Adapting extract_from_pdb to your own environment<a class="headerlink" href="#adapting-extract-from-pdb-to-your-own-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If you have the PDB installed locally, simply set the variable PDB_DIR to the absolute location of the directory in which the PDB is installed. The PDB can either be installed in its divided form or in its full form. If the file you are looking for is neither in the current directory nor in the local PDB version, extract_from_pdb will try to fetch it from rcsb. If you do not want this to happen, you should either set the environment variable NO_REMOTE_PDB_DIR to 1 or use the <strong>-no_remote_pdb_dir</strong> flag:</p>

<h4>What is a good alignment?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-good-alignment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This is a tricky question, a good answer would be  <strong>“a good alignment is an alignment that makes it possible to do good biology”</strong>. In practice, the alignment community has become used to measuring the accuracy of alignment methods using structures. Structures are relatively easy to align correctly, even when the sequences have diverged quite a lot. The most common usage is therefore to compare structure based alignments with their sequence based counterpart and to evaluate the accuracy of the method using these criterions. Unfortunately it is not easy to establish structure based standards of truth. Several of these exist and they do not necessarily agree. To summarize, the situation is as roughly as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Above 40% identity</strong>, all the reference collections do agree with one another and all the established methods give roughly the same results. These alignments can be trusted blindly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Below 40% identity</strong>, all the reference collections stop agreeing and the methods do not give consistent results. In this area of similarity it is not necessarily easy to determine who is right and who is wrong, although most studies indicate that consistency based methods (T-Coffee, ProbCons, MAFFT-slow or MSAProbs) have an edge over traditional methods.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>When dealing with distantly related sequences, the only way to produce reliable alignments is to use structural information. T-Coffee provides many facilities to do so in a seamless fashion. Several important factors need to be taken into account when selecting an alignment method:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>The best methods are not always the best</strong>. Given a difficult dataset, the best method is only more likely to deliver the best alignment, but there is no guaranty it will do so. It is very much like betting on the horse with the best odds.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The difference in accuracy between all the available methods is not incredibly high</strong> (as measured on reference datasets). It is unclear whether this is an artifact caused by the use of ‘easy’ reference alignments, or whether this is a reality. The only thing that can change dramatically the accuracy of the alignment is the use of structural information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keep in mind that these methods have only been evaluated by comparison with reference alignments (benchmarks)</strong>. This is merely one criterion among many. In theory, these methods should be evaluated for their ability to produce alignments that lead to accurate trees, good profiles or good models. Unfortunately, these evaluation procedures do not yet exist.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>There are many MSA packages around, the most common ones being ClustalW, MUSCLE, MAFFT, T-Coffee and ProbCons; amongst the latest ones, you can find phylogeny aware aligners (PRANK and SATé) and modifed/improved consistency based aligners (MSAProbs). You can almost forget about the other packages, as there is virtually nothing you could do with them that you will not be able to do with these packages. All these packages offer a complex trade-off between speed, accuracy and versatility.</p>

<div class="section" id="clustalw-is-really-everywhere">
<h5>ClustalW is really everywhere…<a class="headerlink" href="#clustalw-is-really-everywhere" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>ClustalW is still the most widely used Multiple Sequence Alignment package. Yet things are changing fast and different tests have consistently shown that ClustalW is neither the most accurate nor the fastest package around. This being said, ClustalW is everywhere and if your sequences are similar enough, it should deliver a fairly reasonable alignment.</p>

<h5>MAFFT/MUSCLE to align big datasets<a class="headerlink" href="#mafft-muscle-to-align-big-datasets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>If you have many sequences to align MUSCLE or MAFFT are the obvious choice. MAFFT is often described as the fastest and the most efficient. This is not entirely true, in its fast mode (FFT-NS-1), MAFFT is similar to MUSCLE and although it is fairly accurate, about 5 points less accurate than the consistency based packages (ProbCons and T-Coffee). In its most accurate mode (L-INS-i) MAFFT uses local alignments and consistency, however, it becomes much more accurate but also slower, and more sensitive to the number of sequences. More recently, we have seen growing the number of <strong>(ultra) large scale</strong> aligners such as Clustal Omega, PASTA, UPP, and we hope soon the large scale version of T-Coffee (called MEGA-Coffee).</p>

<h5>T-Coffee/ProbCons, slow but accurate !!!<a class="headerlink" href="#t-coffee-probcons-slow-but-accurate" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>T-Coffee works by first assembling a library and then by turning this library into an alignment. The library is a list of potential pairs of residues. All of them are not compatible and the job of the algorithm is to make sure that as many possible constraints as possible find their way into the final alignment: it is very much like trying to choose a meeting date, and each one says something like ‘I need my Monday morning’, ‘I can’t come on Thursday afternoon’, and so on. In the end you want a schedule that makes everybody happy, if possible. The nice thing about the library is that it can be used as a media to combine as many methods as one wishes. It is just a matter of generating the right constraints with the right method and compile them into the library. ProbCons and MAFFT (L-INS-i) uses a similar algorithm, but with a Bayesian twist in the case of ProbCons. In practice, however, ProbCons and T-Coffee give very similar results and have similar running time. MAFFT is significantly faster.</p>

Just know that 1) if you give an alignment, the gaps will be reset and your alignment will only provide sequences, 2) sequences with the same name between two files are assumed to be the same sequence, 3) ff their sequences differ, they will be aligned and replaced by the consensus of that alignment (process known as sequence reconciliation).

<p>You may also have a bunch of alignments (with the same sequences) that you have either precomputed, assembled manually or received from a colleague. You can also combine these alignments. For instance, let us imagine we generated 4 alignments with ClustalW using different gap penalties. To combine them into ONE single alignment, use the <strong>-aln</strong> flag. The final score indicates a high level of consistency (91%) between all these MSAs, meaning that the final MSA is probably correct.</p>

<h4>Comparing alternative alignments<a class="headerlink" href="#comparing-alternative-alignments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If you change the parameters, you will end up with alternative alignments. It can be interesting to compare them quantitatively. T-Coffee comes along with an alignment comparison module named <strong>aln_compare</strong>. You can use it to estimate the amount of difference between your two alignments either using the Sum-of-Pair score or the column score using the flag <strong>-compare_mode</strong> (sp or column). By default aln_compare returns the SoP score:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$$: t_coffee -other_pg aln_compare -al1 b80.aln -al2 b30.aln -compare_mode sp
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This comparison will return the following result:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">*****************************************************</span>
<span class="n">seq1</span>       <span class="n">seq2</span>          <span class="n">Sim</span>   <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">ALL</span><span class="p">]</span>           <span class="n">Tot</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The interpretation of this output is as follow: b80 is the reference MSA, it contains 19 sequences with an average identity of 33.6%, and is 94.2% identical to the second MSA b30.aln (79686 pairs to be precise). Of course, this does not tell you where are the good bits, but you can get this information for instance residues that have lost more than 50% of their pairing partner between the two alignments are in lower case (command 1) or converted in any character you want (command 2).
The sp score is defined as the number of aligned residue pairs (i.e. not gaps) that are common between the reference (-al1) and the test (-al2) divided by the total numbers of pairs in the reference, while excluding gaps.</p>
<p>Other modes of comparison are available including the TC score</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The tc score is defined as the number of columns in the test MSA (-al2)  that are common between the reference and the test, divided by the total number of columns in the reference. This measure, originally reported in Balibase can be problematic as it treats equaly highly and sparcely populated columns. For this reason the</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$$: t_coffee -other_pg aln_compare -al1 b80.aln -al2 b30.aln -compare_mode column
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The column score is defined as the total number pairs occuring in columns entirely identical between the reference (-al1) and the test (-al2) divided by the total number of pairs in the reference (excluding gaps). This makes the column score the equivalent of a weighted TC score.</p>
<p>It is also possible to print out the conserved positions between MSAs using the following commands.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Command 1:

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>It is important to take into account that the comparison between -al1 and -al2 is not symetrical. It returns the fraction of -al1 residues pairs - by index - that are recovered in -al2. If -al1 is the reference alignment, this number is more or less the equivalent of a sensistivity measure (i.e. how much True positives are recovered). If -al1 is the tartget alignment, this measure becomes the equivalent of a specificity measure (i.e. what is the fraction of residue pairs in the target that are part of the reference).</p>

<div class="section" id="comparing-subsets-of-alternative-alignments">
<h4>Comparing subsets of alternative alignments<a class="headerlink" href="#comparing-subsets-of-alternative-alignments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>It is also possible to restrict the comparison to a specific subset of residues within the target alignment (for instance the core residues if using a structural reference, or the catalytic residues if using functional annotation alignment). This requires a cache in which residues are annotated as being part of the core or not. The cache is a plain text ascii file that can be produced in any way convenient to you. We show below how to produce a cache based on the consistency score and how to use this cache for further comparisons.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$$: t_coffee b11.fa -output aln score_ascii
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This command generates two output files</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">b11.aln</span></code>: the alignment in ClustalW format</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">b11.score_ascii</span></code>: a local reliability score with every residue having a score between 0 and 9</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The target file must then be reformatted so as to decide which residues will be part of the evaluation (c=&gt; core) and which ones will be ignored. In this example we will set the threshild at 7 which means that the comparison will ignore all residues that do not have 70% or more support from the T-Coffee library:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$$: t_coffee -other_pg seq_reformat -in b11.score_ascii -input number_aln -action +convert 0123456i 789c -output fasta_seq &gt; b11.cache

<p>One can then produce a target file with another method</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$$: t_coffee b11.fa -method mafft_pair -outfile b11.tcmafft
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>With the cache, it is then possible to compare the original alignment (b11.aln) while only considering pairs of core residues</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$$: t_coffee -other_pg aln_compare -al1 b11.aln -al2 b11.tcmafft -st b11.cache pep -io_cat &#39;[c][c]=[core]&#39;

<p>This comparison will return the following result:</p>

<p>The output can be interpreted as follows: the core residues - defined as c-c pairs constitute 63.6% of the -al1 alignment. 93.5% of these pairs are recovered in the -al2 alignment. Note that the -io_cat makes it possible to declare as many categories and combinations of categories as one wishes to have. For instance:</p>

<h4>Modifying the default parameters of T-Coffee<a class="headerlink" href="#modifying-the-default-parameters-of-t-coffee" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The main parameters of T-Coffee are similar to those of ClustalW, including a substitution matrix and some gap penalties. In general, T-Coffee’s default is adequate. If, however, you are not satisfied with the default parameters, we encourage you to change the following parameters. Interestingly, most of what we say here holds reasonably well for ClustalW.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-you-guess-the-optimal-parameters">
<h5>Can you guess the optimal parameters?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-you-guess-the-optimal-parameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Here is another tricky question…and the general answer is NO. The matrix and the gap penalties are simplistic attempts at modeling evolution. While the matrices do a reasonable job, the penalties are simply inappropriate: they should have a value that depends on the structure of the protein and a uniform value cannot be good enough. Yet, since we do not have better we must use them…In practice, this means that parameter optimality is a very <em>ad hoc</em> business. It will change from one dataset to the next and there is no simple way to predict which matrix and which penalty will do better. The problem is also that even after your alignment has been computed, it is not always easy to tell whether your new parameters have improved or degraded your MSA.</p>
<p>There is no systematic way to evaluate an MSA. In general, people visually evaluate the alignment, count the number of identical columns and consider that one more conserved column is good news. If you are lucky you may know a few functional features that you expect to see aligned. If you are very lucky, you will have one structure and you can check the gaps fall in the loops. If you are extremely lucky, you will have two structures and you can assess the quality of your MSA. An advantage of T-Coffee is the fact that the overall score of the alignment (i.e. the consistency with the library) is correlated with the overall accuracy. In other words, if you alignment score increases, its accuracy probably increases also. All this being said, consistency is merely an empirical way of estimating the change of parameters and it does not have the predictive power of a BLAST E-Value.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="changing-the-substitution-matrix">
<h5>Changing the substitution matrix<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-the-substitution-matrix" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>T-Coffee only uses the substitution matrix to make the pairwise alignments that go into the library. These are all the global alignments of every possible pair of sequences, and the ten best local alignments associated with every pair of sequences.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>By default, these alignments are computed using a Blosum62 matrix, but you can use any matrix you fancy instead, including: pam120mt, pam160mt, pam250mt, pam350mt, blosum30mt, blosum40mt, blosum45mt, blosum50mt, blosum55mt, blosum62mt, blosum80mt, or even user-provided matrices in the BLAST format (see <strong>T-Coffee Technical Documentation</strong>).</p></li>
<li><p>PAM matrices: These matrices are allegedly less accurate than the Blosum. The index is correlated to the evolutionary distances, you should therefore use the pam350mt to align very distantly related sequences.</p></li>
<li><p>Blosum matrices: These matrices are allegedly the most accurate. The index is correlated to the maximum percent identity within the sequences used to estimate the matrix. you should therefore use the blosum30mt to align very distantly related sequences. Blosum matrices are biased toward protein core regions, explaining why these matrices tend to give better alignments, since by design, they can capture the most evolutionary resilient signal contained in proteins.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Unless you have some structural information available, the only way to tell whether your alignment has improved or not is to look at the score. For instance, if you compute the two following alignments:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$$: t_coffee proteases_small.fasta -matrix=blosum30mt -outfile=b30.aln
$$: t_coffee proteases_small.fasta -matrix=blosum80mt -outfile=b80.aln
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You will get two alignments that have roughly the same score but are slightly different. You can still use these two alternative alignments by comparing them to identify regions that have been aligned identically by the two matrices. These regions are usually more trustworthy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="changing-gap-penalties">
<h5>Changing gap penalties<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-gap-penalties" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>Gap penalties are the core of the matter when it comes to MSAs. An interesting feature of T-Coffee is that it does not really need such penalties when assembling the MSA, because in theory the penalties have already been applied when computing the library. This is the theory, as in practice penalties can help improve the quality of the alignment.</p>
</div>
<p>The penalties can be changed via the flags <strong>-gapopen</strong> for the gap opening penalty and via <strong>-gapext</strong> for the gap extension penalty. The range for gapopen are [-500,-5000], the range for the extension should rather be [-1,-10]. These values do not refer to a substitution matrix, but rather to the values range of the consistency estimation (i.e. ratio) normalized to 10000 for a maximum consistency. The default values are <strong>-gapopen=-50, -gapext=0</strong>. The reasons for these very low values are that they are meant to be cosmetic only, since a trademark of T-Coffee (inherited from Dialign) is not to need explicit penalties. Yet, we know for a fact that alignments with higher gap penalties often look nicer (for publications) and are sometimes more accurate. For instance, you can try:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$$: t_coffee proteases_small.fasta -gapopen -100 -gapext -5
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This gap penalty is only applied at the alignment level (i.e. after the library was computed). If you want to change the gap penalties of the methods used to build the library, you will need to go deeper…Two methods are used by default to build the library (command 1). One does global pairwise alignments and is named slow_pair, the other is named lalign_id_pair and produces local alignments. These methods are specified via the <strong>-method</strong> flag. Usually you do not need to write it because it is the default, but if you want to change the default parameters of the constituting methods (command 2), you will need to do so explicitly (the default parameters are for lalign_id_pair <strong>GOP=-10, GEP=-4, MATRIX=blosum50mt</strong> and for slow_pair <strong>GOP=-10, GEP=-1 and MATRIX=blosum62mt</strong>. Using the command 2, the library is now computed using the Blosum62mt with lalign, rather than the Blosum50mt; the good news is that when using this matrix, the score of our alignment increases from 48 to 50. We assume this new alignment is therefore more accurate than the previous one.</p>

<p>T-Coffee is not very well gifted for aligning large datasets (for now), but you can give it a try using a special option that generates approximate fast alignments (command 1). These MSAs should roughly have the same accuracy as ClustalW, and are quite acceptable for sequences more than 40% identical. This mode works by only considering the best diagonals between two sequences, and by default all the diagonals with substitution score &gt;0 are considered. You can lower this value with the flag <strong>-ndiag</strong> to reduce the running time (command 2).

In this section, we show you how to use M-Coffee to combine many alignments into one single alignment, or how you can specify only the methods you want. M-Coffee is not always the best method, but extensive benchmarks on BAliBASE, PREFAB and HOMSTRAD have shown that it delivers the best alignment 2 times out of 3.

<p>T-Coffee is installed along with many aligners necessary to run M-Coffee for instance, and many more. If you type <strong>t_coffee</strong>, it will display on the screen the different t_coffee options and all the methods included. If you look carefully, you will see that most of the methods exist under two denominations: 1) <strong>&lt;method&gt;_msa</strong> or 2) <strong>&lt;method&gt;_pair</strong>. In the first case, it means that T-Coffee will use the specified method to run your MSA, so you can easily have a ClustalW or a MAFFT alignment using T-Coffee. In the second case, you ask T-Coffee to align every pair of sequence with the specified methods, the final MSA will be computed using the T-Coffee consistency between all the pairs. Go to the <strong>Integrating External Methods in T-Coffee</strong> if you want more information.</p>

If you did a default installation, all the software you need should be there. M-Coffee is a special mode of T-Coffee that you can call using the flag <strong>-mode mcoffee</strong>.

</div>
<p>The final MSA is a combination of all methods. The alignment is colored with the T-Coffee consistency color scheme, but in this case the colors will reflect the consistency between methods: 1) regions in red have a high consistency, so all the methods agree and you can expect them to be fairly accurate, 2) regions in green/blue have the lowest consistency, meaning that all the methods deliver different alignment in these regions and you should not trust them. Overall this alignment has a score of 951 (1000 being the max), which means that it is roughly 95% consistent with the entire collection; this is a fairly high index meaning that you can trust your alignment.</p>

<p>PSI-Coffee is currently the most accurate mode of T-Coffee but also the slowest. Its principle is rather simple: it associates every sequence with a profile of homologous sequences gathered using BLAST on a sequence database (nr by default). PSI-Coffee then uses the profiles instead of the initial sequences to makes a multiple profile alignment (command 1). In a last step, your profiles are replaced by their initial query sequence from your initial dataset and returns a MSA of your sequences. PSI-Coffee can also use reduced database instead of nr (installed locally) in order to speed-up the process. A special mode, TM-Coffee, exists using PSI-Coffee but specialized to align transmembrane proteins using a reduced database of TM proteins and also including a prediction of transmembrane domains with the flag <strong>-template_file PSITM</strong> (command 2). It is much faster as the search database is limited to known transmembrane protein, however, it applies in only specific cases unlike PSI-Coffee which is a general method. You can find more information about TM-Coffee <a class="reference external" href="http://tcoffee.crg.cat/apps/tcoffee/tutorial_tmcoffee.html">here</a>.

<h3>Using protein 2D/3D structural information<a class="headerlink" href="#using-protein-2d-3d-structural-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Using structural information when aligning sequences is very useful. The reason is that structures diverge slower than sequences. As a consequence, one may still find a discernable homology between two sequences that have been diverging for a long time beyond recognition using their corresponding structure. Yet, when assembling a structure based MSA, you will realize that these sequences contain key conserved residues that a simple alignment procedure was unable to reveal. We show you in this section how to make the best of T-Coffee tools to incorporate structural information in your alignment.</p>

<p>Expresso needs BLAST you provide with the tag <strong>-blast</strong> and it also requires the PDB database you can specify via the flag <strong>-pdb_db</strong>.

<h5>How does Expresso/3D-Coffee work?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-expresso-3d-coffee-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Expresso/3D-Coffee is probably one of the most important improvement of T-Coffee. The principle is simple: 1) it first runs a BLAST for every sequence in your dataset against the PDB and finds (or not) a structure similar in sequence (35% identity by default) to be used as a template for structurally aligning your sequence, 2) the correspondence between the query sequences and the templates are stored in a template file which is automatically generated by Expresso. Here lies the difference between 3D-Coffee and Expresso: when running Expresso, fetching structures and creating the template file are automated (so you can reuse it for other applications) while using 3D-Coffee is a bit more tricky as it requires the name of the sequences to correspond to the structure file name (and it does not fetch or create anything for you). Of course, you can create and use your own template with the tag <strong>-template_file</strong> with the same format presented here. At the end, whenever there are enough templates (minimum of two obviously), it will align sequences using the structural information, otherwise sequences will be aligned using the standard T-Coffee aligner.  Of course, if your dataset only contains structures, your alignment becomes a structural alignment.</p>

Used this way, the method will produce for each sequence a secondary prediction file (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;sequence_name&gt;.ssp</span></code>). GOR run on single sequences with a relatively low accuracy, which can be increased by coupling it with BLAST (command 2). When doing so, the predictions for each sequence are obtained by averaging the GOR predictions on every homologue as reported by a BLAST against nr. By default the BLAST is done remotely at the NCBI using the BLASTPGP web service of the EBI.

<p>Pro-Coffee is a MSA method specifically designed for promoter regions or other orthologous DNA regions containing functional elements (enchancers for instance). Pro-Coffee takes nearest-neighbour nucleotide correlations into account when aligning DNA sequence. For this it first translates sequences into a dinucleotide alphabet and then does the alignment using a specifically designed dinucleotide substitution matrix. This matrix was constructed from binding sites alignments from the Transfac database. A benchmark on multispecies ChIP-seq data shows that validated binding sites will be better aligned than when using off-the-shelf methods. To run Pro-Coffee is easy by defaults (command 1), however the user can change empirically all gap parameters in order to improve the MSA (command 2). By default, parameters were optimized on benchmarks (GOP=-60/GEP=-1) but as every dataset is different you may want to see for yourself. Once your alignment is done, you can always use reformatting options in order to extract the regions of interest (command 3).</p>

<h4>Splice variants<a class="headerlink" href="#splice-variants" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Splice variants are especially challenging for most MSA programs, because the splicing variants need very long gaps to be inserted, and most programs attempt to match as many symbols as possible. Standard programs like ClustalW or MUSCLE are not good at dealing with this situation and in our experience, the only programs that can do something with splice variants are those using local information like some flavors of MAFFT and T-Coffee. For instance, if you try muscle on the following dataset with the command 1, you will quickly realize your alignment is not very good and does not show where the alternative splicing co-occurs. On the other hand, if you use T-Coffee (command 2), things become much clearer. The reason why T-Coffee does better than other packages is mostly because it uses local information (lalign_id_pair) and is therefore less sensitive to long gaps. If the default mode does not work for your dataset, you can try to be a bit more aggressive and only use local information to compute your library (command 3). Of course, the most distantly related your sequences, the harder the alignment of splice variants.</p>

<h4>Noisy coding DNA sequences…<a class="headerlink" href="#noisy-coding-dna-sequences" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>When dealing with coding DNA, the right thing to do is to translate your DNA sequence and thread the DNA onto the protein alignment if you really need some DNA. However, sometimes, your cDNA may not be so clean that you can easily translate it (frameshifts and so on). Whenever this happens, try (no warranty) the following special method. The test case in three_dna_seq.fasta contains the DNA sequences of three proteases with a couple of frameshifts here and there. If you make a regular alignment of these sequences (command 1) you see that many gaps have sizes that are not multiple of 3 (codon size). When using an appropriate alignment method that takes into account all the frames at the same time, we get something much more meaningful (command 2). At the end, you can even recover the corrected protein sequence (command 3) using a special option <strong>+clean cdna</strong>, a small HMM that loops through each sequence and select the frame in order to maximize the similarity within the alignment (part of the <strong>seq_reformat</strong> utility).</p>

<h2>Evaluating Your Alignment<a class="headerlink" href="#evaluating-your-alignment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are three possible strategies for evaluating your alignment of protein sequences:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Sequence based methods</strong> like the CORE index and the TCS if you don’t have any structure (quite often). These do pretty well in the core regions of an alignment (which can correspond to protein domains, fold, structural elements, etc…) but can be limited in more variable regions (which can correspond to loops, disordered regions, etc…).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Structure is a killer</strong>, so if you have at least two structures available for your protein family, you are in an ideal situation and you can use the iRMSD. If you only have one structure available, we developped STRIKE to compare alternative alignment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Another killer is the use of functional information</strong>, but it is much less often at hand. If you know some residues MUST be aligned because they are functionally related. As the information is scarce and not standard, there is no automated procedure specifically designed for this kind of analysis but you can still setup an evaluation procedure with T-Coffee.</p></li>

The score reported with every T-Coffee alignment is the concistency score (depending on the version it can be normalized to 100 or 1000). If you want to go further and estimate the local concistency (known as the CORE index), an html file is automatically created each time you run T-Coffee; it is colored version of your alignment where residues are colored according to their consistency score, from blue (low consistency) to red (high consistency). It is not full proof but in principle you can expect positions with a score above 6 to be correctly aligned.</p>

<h5>What is the APDB/iRMSD?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-apdb-irmsd" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>APDB and the iRMSD are two closely related measures meant to evaluate the accuracy of a MSAt without using a structure based reference alignment. The iRMSD is a follow up of the APDB measure and we now recommend using the iRMSD rather than APDB. Although it may seem that the iRMSD was an attempt to get free iPODs from Apple, it is not (or at least we never got the iPODs). The iRMSD is a special RMSD (standing for intramolecular distances based RMSD) where the alignments are evaluated using the structural information of the sequences with known structures.</p>
<p>The strength of the iRMSD is its independence from a specific superposition models. When using the iRMSD to evaluate the score of a MSA, one does not need to superpose the two structures and deduce a sequence alignment that will then be compared with the target alignment. Given two aligned residues (X and Y) the iRMSD score is an attempt to estimate the neighborhood support for the XY alignment. This is done by measuring the difference of distances between X and Y and every other pair of aligned residues within the same sphere (W and Z). The iRMSD is obtained by measuring the average Root Mean Square (RMS) of these differences of distances. The first step of APDB/iRMSD is to measure the distances between the Ca (carbon alpha) of each residue and its neighbors. Neighborhood is defined as a sphere of radius <strong>*-maximum_distance</strong> (10 by default). However, by setting <strong>-local_mode</strong> to ‘window’, the sphere can be replaced with a window of 1/2 size <strong>-maximum_distance</strong> residues.</p>
<p>The lower the iRMSD, the better the alignment. Yet, an alignment can obtain a good iRMSD score by simply having few aligned residues. To avoid this, the program also reports a normalized version of the iRMSD, the NiRMSD= MIN(L1,L2)*iRMSD/Number considered columns. It is recommended to use the NiRMSD to compare alternative alignments of different length. From a structural point of view, the NiRMSD has a meaning very similar to the iRMSD and it behaves in a similar fashion from a numerical point of view (similar ranges in Angstroms).</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>APDB is an older measure less robust than the iRMSD; it is an attempt to estimate the fraction of pairs of residues whose alignment seems to be correct form a structural point of view. The higher APDB, the better the alignment, and conversely the lower the NiRMSD, the better the alignment.</p>

<h5>How to efficiently use structural information?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-efficiently-use-structural-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>When it comes to evaluating MSAs, nothing is better than structural information. To use the methods we describe here, you will need to have at least two structures, similar enough (&gt;60%) to sequences contained in your dataset. Here an outline of the best way to proceed:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Try to include two structures with distantly related sequences, the other sequences being intermediates.</p></li>
<li><p>Align your sequences without using the structural information (i.e. T-Coffee, MUSCLE, MAFFT…).</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate your alignment with iRMSD/NiRMSD (see later in this section); give this alignment the score S1.</p></li>
<li><p>Realign your sequences but this time using structural information with Expresso.</p></li>
<li><p>Measure the score of that alignment; the score will be S2.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>If S1 and S2 are almost similar, it means your distantly related structures were well aligned and you can expect the intermediate sequences to be well aligned as well. If S2 is much better than S1, you can expect the structures to be well aligned in the second alignment, while there is no guarantee that the alignment of the intermediate sequences has improved as well, although in practice it often does.</p>

<h4>STRIKE: Contact based evaluations<a class="headerlink" href="#strike-contact-based-evaluations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>STRIKE uses a contact matrix to evaluate an alignment using one or more structures. When doing so, the contacts are extracted from the sequences with known structures and are tnen projected onto the other sequences. Each sequence is then evaluated for the quality of its predicted contacts. When more than one structure is available, the results are provided using each structure as a template. The following Command line will carry this analysis. It takes as input an MSA containing at least one sequence with one of the templates defiend in the template file. The PDB files must be within the current directory.</p>

<h3>Evaluating a MSA according to your own criterion<a class="headerlink" href="#evaluating-a-msa-according-to-your-own-criterion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Any kind of feature can easily be turned into an evaluation grid. For instance, the protease sequences we have been using here have a well characterized binding site. A possible evaluation can be made as follows: let us consider the UniProt annotation of the two distantly related sequences; these two sequences contain the electron relay system of the proteases. We can use it to build an evaluation library: in P29786 (TRY3_AEDAE) the Histidine residue is at position 68 while in P21844 (MCPT5_MOUSE) the functionally equivalent Histidine residue is at position 66. We can therefore build a library that will check whether these two residues are properly aligned in any MSA. The library will look like this:</p>

<h3>Clustering/Trees based on protein 3D structures<a class="headerlink" href="#clustering-trees-based-on-protein-3d-structures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This section describes tree estimation procedure based on the comparison of intramolecular distances. These methods are slightly different from the <cite>T-RMSD &lt;http://tcoffee.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tcoffee_main_documentation.html#the-t-rmsd&gt;</cite> that was also originally developped for this purpose and whose usage is decribed in the next section. The methods described in this section are more versatile than the original T-RMSD: they support trees based on contacts or intra-molecular distance variations,alternative tree reconstruction algorithms (NJ, UPGMA), genuine column based generalized boostrap procedures. They also support the STRIKE protocol that involves projecting contacts measured within one or more experimental structures onto the sequences these are aligned with and using the <cite>STRIKE &lt;https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/27/24/3385/306640/STRIKE-evaluation-of-protein-MSAs-using-a-single&gt;</cite> contact matrice to score these contacts in the sequences without known structures.</p>

<h4>What is the T-RMSD?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-t-rmsd" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>T-RMSD (Tree based on Root Mean Square Deviation) is a structure based clustering method using the iRMSD to drive the structural clustering of your aligned sequences with available structures. The T-RMSD supports all the parameters supported by iRMSD or APDB. T-RMSD  is a distance RMSD (dRMSD) based method which generate Structural Trees (analogue to phylogenetic tree) to determine fine-grained structural variations associated with a given Multiple Sequence Alignment (generated by the user using the method of is choice). The specificity of T-RMSD compared to other structural comparison methods stems from its capacity to generate a structural tree with values equivalent bootstrap values supporting the structural clustering. Such clustering is achieved by the construction of matrixes of distances, calculated between equivalent residues as defined by the ungapped columns of the given MSA. The resulting matrixes are then combined using the CONSENSE program from the Phylip package to generate a consensus structural tree with equivalent bootstrap values supporting each node (from 0 to 100; 100 indicating that all positions support the clustering).</p>

<h4>Generating a structural tree with support values<a class="headerlink" href="#generating-a-structural-tree-with-support-values" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>T-RMSD is a special modof T-Coffee. To run T-RMSD, you just need a MSA (generated the way you want) and a template file; you need one structure for each sequence, otherwise these sequences will be excluded from the final results. There are several output files:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;input</span> <span class="pre">name&gt;.struc_tree.list</span></code>: list of all individual trees (one per ungapped column)</p></li>

<p>Another important information displayed only on screen is the number of usable positions used to build the clustering.

<h4>Visualizing the structural clustering<a class="headerlink" href="#visualizing-the-structural-clustering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>T-Coffee have limited tree visualization capacities, yet the T-RMSD delivers two relevant files in this matter: the first one is a basic rendering of the tree with the support values for each node (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;input</span> <span class="pre">name&gt;.struc_tree.list</span></code>), the second one is a colored html of the MSA where columns are colored according to their individual support to the final consensus tree (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;input</span> <span class="pre">name&gt;.struc_tree.html</span></code>). If you want to visualize/modify the resulting tree, we recommend to use a dedicated tree viewer such as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.phylowidget.org/">PhyloWidget</a>. By default PhyloWidget is used by the T-RMSD web server, but as the format is standard (Newick format) you can use any viewer you want (iTOL, ETE, FigTree, Phylodendron, etc…)</p>

<h3>The TCS<a class="headerlink" href="#the-tcs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The TCS (Transitive Consistency Score) is a measure of consistency between a multiple sequence alignmment and a library of pairwise alignments of the same sequences. In the original <cite>publication &lt;https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/31/6/1625/2925802/TCS-A-New-Multiple-Sequence-Alignment-Reliability&gt;</cite> the TCS score was shown to correlate well with local structural accuracy and with the phylogenic reconstruction potential of individual MSA columns. As such the TCS can therefore be used to down-weight or filter out the less reliable positions. The TCS is available as <cite>&gt;web-server http://tcoffee.crg.cat/apps/tcoffee/do:core&gt;</cite> and its command line usage is described in details in an <cite>earlier section &lt;http://tcoffee.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tcoffee_main_documentation.html#transitive-consistency-score-tcs&gt;</cite> of this documentation.</p>
<p>It can be used to evaluate and compare existing alignmnets
. The original publication describing it is available
described in the previous subsection as it is mainly an evaluation tool. It has however several option that are relevant for downstream analysis such weighting and/or trimming MSA for phylogenetic reconstruction. It was demonstrated that TCS was able to improve phylogenetic reconstruction, you are welcome to look at the publication for more details.</p>

<h2>Internal/External Methods<a class="headerlink" href="#internal-external-methods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The real power of T-Coffee is its ability to seamlessly combine many methods into one. While we try to integrate as many methods as we can in the default distribution, we do not have the means to be exhaustive and if you desperately need your favorite method to be integrated, you will need to bite the bullet …</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-are-the-methods-already-integrated-in-t-coffee">
<h3>What are the methods already integrated in T-Coffee?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-methods-already-integrated-in-t-coffee" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Although, it does not necessarily do so explicitly, T-Coffee always end up combining libraries (collections of pairs of residues). Given a set of libraries, T-Coffee makes an attempt to assemble the alignment with the highest level of consistence. You can think of the alignment as a timetable, each library pair being a request from students or teachers, and the job of T-Coffee would be to assemble the time table that makes as many people as possible happy…In T-Coffee, methods replace the students/professors to generate constraints. These methods can be any standard/non standard alignment methods that can be used to generate alignments (pairwise, most of the time). These alignments can be viewed as collections of constraints that must be fit within the final alignment. Of course, the constraints do not have to agree with one another…</p>
<p>This section shows you what are the available method in T-Coffee, and how you can add your own methods either through direct parameterization or via a perl script. There are two kinds of methods: the internal and the external. For the internal methods, you simply need to have T-Coffee up and running. The external methods are generally installed with T-Coffee (when using the installer), but if you have problems with some packages, refer to the <strong>T-Coffee Installation</strong> chapter.</p>
<div class="section" id="internal-methods-built-in">
<h4>INTERNAL methods (built-in)<a class="headerlink" href="#internal-methods-built-in" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Internal methods can be requested using the following names:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>proba_pair</strong>: adapted from ProbCons, this method (the current default) uses a pair HMM to compute a pairwise alignment with a biphasic gap penalty.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>fast_pair</strong>: makes a global fasta style pairwise alignment. For proteins: <strong>matrix=blosum62mt, gep=-1, gop=-10, ktup=2</strong>. For DNA, <strong>matrix=idmat (id=10), gep=-1, gop=-20, ktup=5</strong>. Each pair of residue is given a score function of the weighting mode defined by <strong>-weight</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>slow_pair</strong>: identical to fast pair, but does a full dynamic programming, using the myers and miller algorithm. This method is recommended if your sequences are distantly related.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ifast_pair</strong>: iterative fast_pair.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>islow_pair</strong>: makes a global fasta alignmnet using the previously computed pairs as a library. <cite>i</cite> stands for iterative. Each pair of residue is given a score function of the weighting mode defined by <strong>-weight</strong>. The library used for the computation is the one computed before the method is used. The result is therefore dependent on the order in methods and library are set via the <strong>-in</strong> flag.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>align_pdb_pair</strong>: uses the <strong>align_pdb</strong> routine to align two structures. The pairwise scores are those returnes by the <strong>align_pdb</strong> program. If a structure is missing, fast_pair is used instead. Each pair of residue is given a score function defined by align_pdb. [UNSUPPORTED]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>lalign_id_pair</strong>: uses the ten top non intersecting local alignments, as delivered by lalign. Each alignement is weighted with its average percent identity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>lalign_rs_s_pair</strong>: Same as above but does also does self comparison and uses the lalign raw_score (s stands for self). This is needed when extracting repeats. [UNSUPPORTED]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Matrix Amy</strong>: matrix can be requested, simply indicate as a method the name of the matrix preceded with an X (i.e. Xpam250mt). If you indicate such a matrix, all the other methods will simply be ignored, and a standard fast progressive alignment will be computed. If you want to change the substitution matrix used by the methods, use the <strong>-matrix</strong> flag.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>cdna_fast_pair</strong>: this method computes the pairwise alignment of two cDNA sequences. It is a fast_pair alignment that only takes into account the aminoacid similarity with different penalties for insertions and frameshifts. This alignment is turned into a library where matched nucleotides receive a score equal to the average level of identity at the aminoacid level. This mode is intended to clean cDNA obtained from ESTs or to align pseudo-genes. [UNSUPPORTED]</p></li>

<h4>Weighting your method<a class="headerlink" href="#weighting-your-method" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>By default, the alignment produced by your method will be weighted according to its percent identity. However, this can be customized via the <strong>WEIGHT</strong> parameter, which supports all the values of the <strong>-weight</strong> flag. The only difference is that the <strong>-weight</strong> value thus declared will only be applied onto your method. If needed you can also modify on the fly the WEIGHT value of your method:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Increases by a factor 2 the weight of slow_pair:
$$: t_coffee sample_seq1.fasta -method slow_pair@WEIGHT@OW2

<h4>Managing a collection of method files<a class="headerlink" href="#managing-a-collection-of-method-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>It may be convenient to store all the method files in a single location on your system. By default, T-Coffee will go looking into the directory ~/.t_coffee/methods/. You can change this by either modifying the <strong>METHODS_4_TCOFFEE</strong> in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">define_headers.h</span></code> (and recompile) or by modifying the environement variable <strong>METHODS_4_TCOFFEE**</strong>.</p>

<h3>Creating your own T-Coffee libraries<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-your-own-t-coffee-libraries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If the method you want to use is not integrated or impossible to integrate, you can generate your own libraries, either directly or by turning existing alignments into libraries. You may also want to precompute your libraries, in order to combine them at your convenience.</p>
<div class="section" id="using-precomputed-alignments">
<h4>Using precomputed alignments<a class="headerlink" href="#using-precomputed-alignments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If the method you wish to use is not supported, or if you simply have the alignments, the simplest thing to do is to generate yourself the pairwise/multiple alignments, in FASTA, ClustalW, MSF or PIR format and feed them into T-Coffee. You can even combine multiple MSAs (refers to subsection <strong>Combining multiple MSAs</strong>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="customizing-the-weighting-scheme">
<h4>Customizing the weighting scheme<a class="headerlink" href="#customizing-the-weighting-scheme" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The previous integration method forces you to use the same weighting scheme for each alignment and the rest of the libraries generated on the fly. This weighting scheme is based on global pairwise sequence identity. If you want to use a more specific weighting scheme with a given method, you should either generate your own library (command 1) or convert your alignment into a library (command 2), or use the <strong>-weight</strong> flag (command 3).</p>

<h4>Generating your own libraries<a class="headerlink" href="#generating-your-own-libraries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This is suitable if you have local alignments, or very detailed information about your potential residue pairs, or if you want to use a very specific weighting scheme. You will need to generate your own libraries using the format described in the last section. You may also want to precompute your libraries in order to save them for further use. For instance, in the following example, we generate the local (command 1) and the global (command 2) libraries and later reuse them for combination into a multiple alignment. Once these libraries have been computed, you can then combine them at your convenience in a single MSA (command 3). Of course you can decide to only use the local or the global library.</p>

<h3>Plug-out: using T-Coffee as a plug-in<a class="headerlink" href="#plug-out-using-t-coffee-as-a-plug-in" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Just because it enjoys enslaving other methods as plug-in does not mean that T-Coffee does not enjoy being incorporated within other packages. We try to give as much support as possible to anyone who wishes to incorporate T-Coffee in an alignment pipeline. If you want to do so, please work out some way to incorporate T-Coffee in your script. If you need some help along the way, do not hesitate to ask, as we will always be happy to either give assistance or even modify the package so that it accomodates as many needs as possible. Once that procedure is over, set aside a couple of input files with the correct parameterisation and send them to us. These will be included as a distribution test, to insure that any further distribution remains compliant with your application.</p>
